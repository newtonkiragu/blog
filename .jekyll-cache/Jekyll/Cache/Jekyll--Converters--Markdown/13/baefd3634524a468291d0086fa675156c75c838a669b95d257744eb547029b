I"`<p>The one thing programmers like is efficiency. How lean is their code, how much time does it take for their code to run? Were they fast enough? Is there a simpler way to implement it without corrupting data. A lot flows into our mind as we continue churning out applications day in day out in terms of how to scale it and make it more efficient.</p>
