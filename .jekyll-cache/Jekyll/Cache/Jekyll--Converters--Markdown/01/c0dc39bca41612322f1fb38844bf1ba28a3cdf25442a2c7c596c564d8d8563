  <p>Time, who has time? If you never take time, how can you ever have time?</p>

<p>It gets to a point in your life where you get a paradigm shift. Suddenly, this new perspective pops into your mind.</p>

<p>In that moment of clarity, you are left in wonder and amazement at how limited your perspective was. I was in a stack-overflow rabbit-hole when I got my paradigm shift.</p>

<p>I have always wanted to be a teacher. Simply because, I love sharing. Sometimes I find that I overshare things. I enjoy sharing things I have learnt. A human cannot live without thinking, consciously or subconsciously. 
The more you think, the more thoughts you have, I think. Things simply couldn’t keep on moving the way they have been. I had to make a huge change.</p>

<p>To come to an informed decision, I had to sit down and asked myself deep and profound questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Who am I?</li>
  <li>What do I wanna do in this life?</li>
  <li>How can I be able to teach and share the little things I learn over time?</li>
  <li>Did I remember to turn on the coffee machine?</li>
</ul>

<p>As these thoughts ploughed my mind, I remembered a quote by a famous bon mott.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>He who asks a question is a fool for five minutes; he who does not ask a question remains a fool forever.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That inspired me to ask myself even more questions.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Is this how Thanos felt as he came up with his decisions to destroy half the human population? I am inevitable.</li>
</ul>

<p>The solution was quite simple. <strong>You’re looking at it</strong>.</p>

<p>I created a blog. Built with <code class="highlighter-rouge">jekyll</code> (blog explaining how to create one and deploy coming soon), I decided to come up with a platform where I can write down my thoughts and over share them to the world.</p>
