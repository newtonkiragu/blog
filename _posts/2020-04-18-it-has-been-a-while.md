> It is a dangerous business... <br/>
  Going out your door <br/>
  You step onto the road and if you don't keep your feet... <br/>
  There's no knowing where you might be swept off to <br/>

It has been a while since I've written, <br/>
It has been forever since I've felt, <br/>
Not because I'm distracted, smitten, <br/>
Nor has my ice heart melt. <br/>

I have failed to write because, <br/>
Because words and worlds a new, <br/>
Written on paper with cause, <br/>
Cannot distract my eyes. <br/>

The emotions displayed openly, <br/>
In writing, cannot be aired out, <br/>
The gasp and sigh escape unwillingly, <br/>
As my elastic heart finally goes taut.  <br/>

Aaah, but the days we had, <br/>
The days when the earth was still young, <br/>
The days we allowed ourselves to feel sad, <br/>
I wonder at what we have now become. <br/>

indifferent, manipulative and cold, <br/>
Eyes void of emotions, yet beautiful than most, <br/>
Hearts that feel absolutely nothing yet bold, <br/>
We are all but covered in frost. <br/>

I propose a toast, <br/>
To the joy and sadness, <br/>
That we used to brag about and boast, <br/>
As I go back to my madness  <br/>
