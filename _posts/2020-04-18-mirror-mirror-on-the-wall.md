> I'll get used to it but these last months <br/>
I wavered away from me <br/>
Without realizing of what was happening to me <br/>
And it arrived without seeing it come <br/>
Forced notoriety, I take a lot of pleasure in it <br/>
Even if I'm losing my freedom <br/>
Wanting to succeed too much, the pressure of success <br/>
The people, them and us, what are we going to become? <br/>

I used to recognise myself  <br/>
It's funny how reflections change <br/>
When we're becoming something else <br/>
I think it's time to walk away <br/>

I used to hate how I looked like in the mirror, <br/>
Thus because I knew who I was, <br/>
And loathed who I was becoming. <br/>
There was hope however, cause I knew. <br/>

I look at myself right now, <br/>
My reflection displays to me nothing but despair, <br/>
No hope, no glint, no passion left. <br/>
No comfort anywhere. <br/>

I take the last fleeting look at myself in the mirror, <br/>
Thinking to break the glass, <br/>
For I am curious to view the contents of my carotid artery. <br/>
Hoping in the process, to end my misery. <br/>

There is no hope, no peace, no love, <br/>
Only despair, pain, torment, and nothingness. <br/>
Unable to even hate, simply existing. <br/>
I wish to understand emotions, or get rid of them for good <br/>
