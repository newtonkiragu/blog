> For nothing loved is ever lost. <br/>
  And I will always love you dear brother

Death my old friend, <br/>
Today I laid my eyes on you again, <br/>
Winking at me you old fiend, <br/>
And filling my heart with excruciating pain. <br/>

Once again you came close to me, <br/>
Danced around the rim of my life, <br/>
Before taking a brother for to be, <br/>
Oh, but the day we will settle this spife. <br/>

Death my dear, <br/>
You fill people's heart with fear, <br/>
Making the strongest shed a tear, <br/>
Oh how I wish to smite you with a spear.  <br/>

We will soon meet I assume, <br/>
Before engulfing me with hell's fumes, <br/>
You will dance to my tune, <br/>
Just as you take my life you goon. <br/>

Ah, but I thank you, <br/>
I await our meeting impatiently, <br/>
For I know you are my salvation, <br/>
A chance to begin my life anew. <br/>

> Therefore I wonâ€™t think of you as gone away, <br/>
  For your journey has just begun. <br/>
  Life holds so many facets, <br/>
  This earth is only one. <br/>
